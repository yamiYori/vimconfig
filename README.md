# Vim Config

This is my vim config. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about vim. All config options are `ONLY TESTED ABOVE VIM 9.0`. If you are using an older version of vim. You may want to upgrade it.

Some package managers don't offer the latest version of vim, and if you install vim by source code, you may want to set the vim to be a default editor. run `add-alternative.sh` to do so.

## Usage

Just run `main.sh`
